# Blade-Design-According-to-Betz-for-the-NREL-5MW-Wind-Turbine
In this exercise, blades according to Betz should be designed for the NREL 5MW Reference Wind Turbine and compared to the original blades.

In this exercise, blades according to Betz should be designed for the NREL 5MW Reference Wind
Turbine [1] and compared to the original blades. In this exercise we will use only the airfoil NACA64-
A17 for the sake of simplicity. For the original blades, more airfoils are used.
